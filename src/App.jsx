        The busduct enclosures are supported by adjustable hangers that allow
        for quick surface mounting along a ceiling or beam. It mentions that the
        spacing between suspension points is 2 meters. The adjustable nature of
        the hangers means that the lighting level can be changed even after
        assembly.

        <strong>Outlets:</strong>
        <br />
        Outlets are distributed regularly at intervals of one meter or as per

        Double head bolts are used as optional. One head breaks at the required
        torque so no need for torque wrenches. Smart bolts can be used also as
        optional for critical sites. Using smart bolts results in less fatigue
        for installers, no repeated torque wrench calibration, no sample
        re-tightening, no turn-of-nut confirmation required. Installers can
        easily identify and focus on loose bolts to re-tighten. The ability to

        Joints in all ratings are of a two bolt patent design, which can be
        checked for tightness without de-energizing the system. This design
        ensures excellent contact between each set of the busbars and the joint.
        This method exerts more than two tons of pressure on overlapping bus
        bars at each bolt. This force is distributed over the contact area by
        two pairs of large diameter spring steel conical shape washers. These

        Joint alignment is made by two bolts instead of one bolt in the single

        joint even with non skilled labor. The joint temperature is less than
        rest of the busduct due to the specially designed heat sinks and contact
        surface. Figure A shows the contact resistance at different torque with
        the washers. The tightening torque of joint bolt does not run down after

        Lectro has manufactured and installed hundreds of thousands of meters of
        busducts for large and small projects since 1975, both for the domestic
        market and for exports around the globe. The production takes place in a
        state of the art facility, using latest generation precision techniques
        including CNC, automation systems and robotics. Lectro products have
        been type tested by DEKRA laboratories of the Netherlands. Lectro
        busduct systems contain high quality components and are trusted for
        their high safety factor and long life. Lectro newest range, The «series
        LSB PRO» busduct provide currents from 1000A to 6400A. We pride
        ourselves in delivering systems which exceed the expectation of our
        customers, both in terms of quality and in the level of customer service
        we provide.

        <br />
        Lectrobars are fabricated from high strength pure electrolytic copper
        with suitable cross section tin coated at contacts ( conductivity better
        than 99.5%). Tin coating provides surface protection and good contact.

        Lectrobar busducts have a sandwich type non-ventilated configuration.
        The non-ventilated housing design excludes potential points of
        penetration by moisture and dust. Busbars for plug-in applications, have
        full size welded conductor tabs. This design extends the contact
        surfaces outside of the busduct casing and into the plug-in outlet. By
        this design, true sandwich configuration is maintained throughout the
        entire busduct length for both feeder and plug-in. This will eliminate
        the need to seperate or flare the conductor bars at the plug-in opening.
